== etcd-backup
This role creates a cron job which peforms the following

- creates a snapshot of the etcd database
- saves the snapshot to an pvc volume

The cron job creates a new pod with the exact same image as the etcd pods
The reson why we are using the same image as the etcd pods is to make sure
that the image has the etcdctl command backed into the image.

The cron job pods use a node selector to make sure that they are scheduled to
the master nodes. We do so that we can map a couple of paths for the master
nodes to the cron job pod.

The following host paths on the master are mapped

* /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/etcd-member
* /etc/etcd
* /etc/kubernetes
* /usr/local/bin

The `/etc/` folders makes available the kubernetes config folder and the etcd
config folder and etcd certificates. The path `/usr/local/bin` is mounted so
that we have access to the backup script etcd-snapshot-backup.sh within the
cron job pod.

The default backup script `/usr/local/bin/etcd-snapshot-backup.sh` calls a
function
link:https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/blob/master/templates/master/00-master/_base/files/usr-local-bin-openshift-recovery-tools-sh.yaml#L22-L43[dl_etcdctl]
that goes out to the internet and downloads the etcdctl binaries inorder to
perform an backup operaion. In a connected environment this works great. In a
disconnected envrionment this results in the backups failing.

The below have been added to make this cron job work in a disconnected
environment. A ConfigMap is created to attach/mount 2 bash scrips

- etcd-backup.sh
- etcd-snapshot-backup-disconnected.sh

The cron job will invoke the first bash scritpt -
`/usr/local/bin/etcd-backup.sh`

The *etcd-backup.sh* script will first attempt to perform a backup as per
the official documentation by invoking the script
`/usr/local/bin/etcd-snapshot-backup.sh`

In a disconnectd the above script will fail. If the default backup script
returns a non-zero exit code, we call the disconnected backup script.
*/usr/local/bin/etcd-snapshot-backup-disconnected.sh*

The disconnected backup script is identical to the orignal script
The only changes are

- the ETCDCTL var now points to a local copy of etcdctl
- the function to download etcdctl was removed

See diff below
```
[root@helper bin]# diff etcd-snapshot-backup-disconnected.sh etcd-snapshot-backup.sh

< ETCDCTL="/usr/bin/etcdctl"

=== Requirements
The role assumes that your cluster has a working default storageclass. A PVC
claim is made to store the etcd snapshots in a persistent manner. So having a
fully function default sotrage class is a prerequisite.

=== Role Variables
Default role variables that are defined.

```
etcd_cluster_id: "demo"
etcd_backup_volume_size: "10Gi"
etcd_backup_namespace: "openshift-cluster-ops"
etcd_backup_username: "etcd-backup-user"
```
You would want to atleast override the `etcd_cluster_id` and the
`etcd_backup_volume_size` variables when invoking the role.

=== Dependencies
This ansible role requires that you are have an authenticated kubectl session
which has sufficient previlegges to create namespaces, and create cronjobs
as well as create a service account with escalated privilleges.


=== Assumptions
An assumption is made that the end user has a backup policy in place to backup
the pvc volume where the etcd snapshots are saved. This role was first written
for a OCP 4.2 UPI cluster on VSphere. The customer had regular daily snapshots
for the vmdks that where taken and stored external to the cluster.

=== Example Usage
Example invocation of the role in a playbook

[source,yaml]
----
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: etcd-backup
----

OR if you want to override some default variables

[source,yaml]
----
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: etcd-backup
      vars:
        etcd_cluster_id: "prod"
        etcd_backup_volume_size: "100Gi"
----

If you would like to use the role without including it or writing a playbook,
from the root of this github repo you can run the following.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook roles/etcd-backup/apply/main.yml \
                 -e etcd_cluster_id=prod \
                 -e etcd_backup_volume_size=100Gi
----

IMPORTANT: The default schedule for the cron job is every 5 minutes. I believe
that this is excessive. However keeping it short was handy for troubleshooting.

TODO:

  - Make the cron schedule a vairable so that it can be customised.
